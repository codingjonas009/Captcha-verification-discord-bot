## üìä Verification System Flow
1. User clicks the "Verify" button on the verification message
2. Bot sends a CAPTCHA image in an ephemeral (private) message
3. User enters the CAPTCHA text in the modal dialog
4. If correct, user receives the verified role and gains access
5. If incorrect, user can retry (up to configured maximum)
6. After too many failures, a timeout period is enforced
