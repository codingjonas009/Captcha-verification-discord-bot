## üìä Verification System Flow
1. User clicks the "Verify" button on the verification message
2. Bot sends a CAPTCHA image in an ephemeral (private) message
3. User enters the CAPTCHA text in the modal dialog
4. If correct, user receives the verified role and gains access
5. If incorrect, user can retry (up to configured maximum)
6. After too many failures, a timeout period is enforced

## üîí Security Features
- **Progressive Difficulty**: CAPTCHA difficulty increases with failed attempts
- **Timeout Mechanism**: Prevents brute-force attacks
- **Image Distortion**: Multiple distortion techniques make automation difficult
- **Ephemeral Messages**: Private verification that only the user can see
- **Database Tracking**: Monitors verification attempts and suspicious patterns
